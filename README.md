**WARNING** UPDATER IS BROKEN, PLEASE DONT USE IT AND INSTEAD UPDATE MANUALLY!!

# Lorelei

Open-Source discord bot in python, for people
> disclaimer: Youre permited to host it yourself for personal purposes like single server or testings, for more than 100 servers, message me on discord (@cosita3cz)

## Why?

Because having too much of bots is very annoying, every single one have different configurations, web dashboards, and you can get lost quickly in it. Also most good bots these days are paid and very limited for free (hope dyno stays free üôè). This is where my bot comes with all inside discord. Its free, its open-source, and you can do alot with it, edit it for your own needs, or help other people by making your own commands to the main bot.

## Installation

### Systemd

You can use systemd (linux) to run this bot

1. Put it in your desired directory (preffering `/var/lorelei-bot`)
2. Edit `lorelei.service` to match user with permissions to the directory (or leave on root, which can be unsafe) and directory to the folder
3. Place `lorelei.service` into `/etc/systemd/system/`
4. Create file named `.secret.key` and put your token inside
5. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(if you wanna run it as root, place `sudo` before command)

6. Enable and start the service
```bash
sudo systemctl enable lorelei.service
sudo systemctl start lorelei.service
```

### Pterodactyl

You can also run it using pterodactyl (UPTDATER DOESNT HAVE TO WORK)

1. Place repository into root of the pterodactyl
2. Add all requirements from `requirements.txt` into your settings
3. Set main file as `run.py`
4. (Optional) Disable autoupdate in `config.py` for better stability, **You will have to update manually**
5. Start with main.py
