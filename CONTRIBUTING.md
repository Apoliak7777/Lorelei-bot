    ```

3. **Edit the Main Branch**: You don't need to create a new branch. Just edit the main branch in your fork.

4. **Edit Language Files**: Navigate to the `data/lang` directory and edit the appropriate language file or create a new one if it doesn't exist. Use the existing files as a reference for the format.

5. **Do Not Update Translation Progress Manually**: The translation progress percentage is updated automatically after editing the language files. **Do not update the percentage manually**.

   Upload it using commit button or with commands:
